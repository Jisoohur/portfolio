##### Abstract

As innovation increasingly requires the integration of technological functionality with aesthetic design and user experience, firms benefit from inventors who can operate across both domains. This study investigates dual-domain inventors—those who contribute to both utility and design patents—as a distinct category of innovation talent. While prior research has emphasized technological specialization, less is known about how inventors who bridge design and technology contribute to innovation outcomes. Using a dataset of patents from 3,110 U.S. public firms, we compare the inventive performance of dual-domain inventors to those engaged solely in technology development. The results show that dual-domain inventors produce higher-value patents, particularly when their technological knowledge occupies central positions within the firm’s internal knowledge network. These findings underscore the strategic value of integrating design and technology expertise in product development, highlighting how cross-domain capabilities and organizational knowledge positioning jointly enhance innovation outcomes.
