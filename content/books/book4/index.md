##### Abstract

Integrating design and technological innovations into the new product development process is critical for effective product development and market success. This study examines the effects of firms’ capability to effectively integrate design and technology throughout the process, which we refer to as ‘design-engineering capability,’ on financial performance and its moderating effect on the relationship between firms’ innovation activity and financial performance. Using patent data for 1,659 US-headquartered public firms from 1980 to 2015, the results of panel generalised least squares regressions confirm both the direct and moderating effects of design-engineering capability on firm performance. These results highlight the importance of strong integration of design and technology expertise within the organization.
