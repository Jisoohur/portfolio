##### Abstract

This study investigates how inter-industry inventor mobility—the movement of inventors across sectoral boundaries—affects the novelty of technological inventions at both the firm and industry levels. While prior research has documented the innovation benefits of inventor mobility, it has largely focused on movements within industries and firm-level outcomes, leaving open questions about how cross-industry mobility shapes the novelty of inventions produced by individual inventors. Drawing on theories of knowledge recombination and absorptive capacity, we argue that moving across industries exposes inventors to more heterogeneous knowledge domains, disrupts entrenched search routines, and expands access to non-redundant external networks. These mechanisms enhance the likelihood of generating novel combinations of technological knowledge. We test these arguments using a large-scale matched panel dataset combining inventor-level patent data from PATSTAT and firm-level data from ORBIS, covering over 1 million inventors across 82,000 European manufacturing firms between 2000 and 2022. Using logistic regression and propensity score matching, we find that while inventor mobility in general contributes to innovation, inter-industry mobility has a particularly strong and consistent effect on generating inventions that are novel to both the hiring firm and the broader industry. These findings highlight inter-industry mobility as a distinct and underexplored mechanism for organizational learning and knowledge diversification, with implications for strategic hiring and innovation management.
