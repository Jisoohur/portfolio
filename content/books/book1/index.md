##### Abstract

This study investigates the implications of knowledge overlap between inventors on patent performance, focusing specifically on the quality, quantity, and novelty of inventions. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the PATSTAT database, we analyze 3,352,202 inventor pairs from patents filed by US-headquartered publicly traded firms between 1980 and 2015. Our analysis reveals that while a higher degree of knowledge overlap between inventors typically increases the quantity of patents produced, it negatively impacts the patents' value and novelty. Notably, the relationship between knowledge overlap and both patent value and novelty exhibit a curvilinear (U-shaped) pattern, suggesting that beyond a certain threshold, increased knowledge overlap can enhance both the quality and novelty of inventions. This study contributes to the existing literature by underscoring the importance of balancing knowledge diversity and shared expertise in fostering innovation.
