##### Abstract

Regional specialization is a key driver of economic growth and innovation, rooted in the ability of regions to build on their existing knowledge and capabilities to develop expertise in new, related fields. The principle of relatedness underscores this process, suggesting that the alignment between a regionâ€™s current knowledge base and emerging fields significantly influences its capacity for innovation and diversification. Traditional methods for measuring this alignment often rely on static classification systems, which may overlook the complexity and interdisciplinarity nature of contemporary innovation. This study introduces the concept of semantic proximity, which evaluates the alignment of regional knowledge bases with emerging fields by analyzing the semantic content of scientific outputs. Using quantum science as a case study, we investigate its relationship with existing regional knowledge bases across European NUTS-3 regions from 2010 to 2021. Employing BERTopic, an advanced topic modeling technique, we map regional knowledge spaces and quantify their semantic alignment with quantum science. Our findings reveal that regions with higher semantic proximity to quantum science are more likely to generate new knowledge in this field. These results underscore the critical role of knowledge alignment in fostering regional specialization. The study offers actionable insights for policymakers seeking to promote innovation and regional development in emerging fields.
